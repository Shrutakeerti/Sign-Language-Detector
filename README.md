This project is a Sign Language Detector web application built using a dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. It allows users to upload images or use their webcam to detect and classify ASL signs in real-time.

Features
Real-time Detection: Detect ASL signs using webcam input.
Upload Image: Upload images containing ASL signs for detection.
Classification: Classify detected signs into predefined ASL gestures.
Technologies Used
Python: Backend logic for image processing and classification.
TensorFlow/Keras: Machine learning model training and inference.
OpenCV: Real-time webcam input processing.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development for user interface and interaction.
Dataset
The model is trained on the ASL dataset, which includes a variety of hand gestures representing letters and common signs in American Sign Language.
